A Todo List is an organizational tool used to record and track tasks that need to be completed. These tasks can be daily or weekly in nature, encompassing work, study, or personal life. It allows individuals to prioritize tasks and identify what needs to be done at a later time.

The simplicity and effectiveness of Todo Lists lie in their ability to provide an overview of pending tasks and organize them, helping to increase productivity and achieve goals more efficiently. Todo Lists can be managed manually using paper or through smartphone and computer applications, making them a practical and useful tool in daily life.
